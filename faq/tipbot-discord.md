# TipBot \(Discord\)

## Information

Tips, in **Sirius \(SIRX\)**, are an integral part of our community because they allow us to reward members for their contributions - whether that's for sharing something insightful, providing feedback, completing bounties, testing our various apps or helping promote Sirius vision and technology.

You can earn them, share, or transfer them via simple commands on the Discord server by interacting with the TipBot.

It is important to note that the SIRX stored as a result of a tip is tied to your Discord account username and are stored on SIRX's wallet server. It is your responsibility to withdraw the tips to your Sirius Core wallet. If you plan on storing SIRX on the Discord server, it is a good idea to enable Two Factor Authentication \(2FA\) on your account. The Sirius Team takes no responsibility for lost funds due to negligence.

Use the following commands to make amazing things happen. We recommend running them in the `#bots-gifs-nonsense` channel, unless you are tipping someone!
