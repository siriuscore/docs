# How do I use the Twitter TipBot?

## Information

Tips, in **Sirius \(SIRX\)**, are an integral part of our community because they allow us to reward members for their contributions - whether that's for sharing something insightful, providing feedback, completing bounties, testing our various apps or helping promote Sirius vision and technology.

You can earn them, share, or transfer them through simple Tweets by tagging the [**TipBot Twitter account**](https://twitter.com/SiriusTipBot) + **command**.

It is important to note that the Sirius stored as a result of a tip is tied to your Discord account username and are stored on Sirius wallet server. It is your responsibility to withdraw the tips to your Sirius Core wallet. If you plan on storing SIRX on the Discord server, it is a good idea to enable [Two Factor Authentication \(2FA\)](https://authy.com) on your account. The Sirius Team takes no responsibility for lost funds due to negligence.

First follow the [@SiriusTipBot](https://twitter.com/SiriusTipBot) account. Then create a new Tweet by tagging the [@SiriusTipBot](https://twitter.com/SiriusTipBot), followed by the command you want. If the TipBot account is already tagged in a thread, only command is required.

> Note: Be sure to keep the commands in a row, if they are in multiple rows, the command will not work.
